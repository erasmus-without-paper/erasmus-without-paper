Erasmus Without Paper (EWP) - Technical Documentation
=====================================================

[What is the status of this document?](statuses.md)


Preamble
--------

This page is written by developers and **for developers**. You'll need to have
experience with Git to be able to work with GitHub properly.

 * If you are not a developer, please assign a developer from your team to
   keep track of all changes to EWP pages (just click the "Watch" button in
   the header of the subprojects you want to watch).

 * These developers MUST be able to propose new changes to the API and accept
   API change proposals from other developers in the name of the partner (we
   will provide each other ample time for reading all the proposed changes).

**Erasmus Without Paper (EWP)** project aims to ease exchanging data on student
mobility between computer systems in different countries. In order to join EWP,
you will need to implement a subset of its APIs. We require all partners to
follow some basic rules described in the documents below.


Rules for working with technical docs within EWP
------------------------------------------------

These documents are our proposals on **how** to work with the technical
documentation within the EWP project (where to store it, how to submit change
proposals, etc.). These documents are currently DRAFTs only, and need to be
reviewed and accepted by all the partners before we start defining APIs.

 * [The Structure of EWP Repositories](repos.md)
 * [Rules for API Design, Usage and Versioning](api-design.md)
 * [Determining the statuses of documents](statuses.md)
 * [Rules for Submitting API Change Proposals](change-proposals.md)
 * [The list of developer representatives of EWP partners](partners.md)
 * [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)


Issue tracker?
--------------

*The location of the issue tracker is yet to be agreed upon.*

GitHub offers built-in issue tracking which would be entirely sufficient for
purposes of developing the software and its documentation. However:

 * There are also other (external) issue trackers which would also suffice for
   this particular purpose.

 * If GitHub turns out to be NOT sufficient for other parts of the EWP project
   (and developers are not the only ones who need issue tracking) - then we
   SHOULD try to find a common solution which would play out well for everyone.

 * We SHOULD have only one issue tracker. Having multiple issue trackers might
   lead to confusion. E.g. a term "issue #123" might become ambiguous.
